            <p>In this section, I'll explain why CikadaKing looks the way that he does.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The main inspiration's behind CikadaKing's design are the pok√©mon Ninjask, with a few other inspirations as well.</li>
                <li>CikadaKing wears a ninjalike outfit with a crown over his head which floats in reference to the halo above Shedinja.</li>
                <li>The wings on his back were heavily inspired by Perfect Cell's wings. They are long and beetlelike in nature,
                    but they flow smoothly.
                </li>
                <li>The scarf on his neck seems to phase in and out of his body occassionally. This is due to the idea that it is meant
                    to resemble a shadow, a common area for stealthy characters to hide.
                </li>
                <li>CikadaKing stands out from other VTubers because he not only has dynamic expressions, but he can also wave at the 
                    viewers!</li>
